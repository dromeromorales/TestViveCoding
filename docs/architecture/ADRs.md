# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
Need to build a maintainable API with clear separation of concerns and testability.

### Decision
Implement Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with the following layers:
- **API Layer**: Controllers, Swagger documentation
- **Application Layer**: Use Cases, DTOs
- **Domain Layer**: Business entities, rules, specifications
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence, external services

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Highly testable (dependency inversion)
- ✅ Framework-independent business logic
- ✅ Easy to swap infrastructure components

**Negative:**
- ❌ More initial complexity
- ❌ More files and abstractions

## ADR-002: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
Business rules need to be clearly expressed and validated consistently.

### Decision
Apply DDD principles:
- Business logic in domain entities
- Rich domain models with behavior
- Domain exceptions for business rule violations
- Ubiquitous language throughout codebase

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ Business rules centralized and explicit
- ✅ Domain model reflects business understanding
- ✅ Reduced risk of business logic leakage

**Negative:**
- ❌ Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with DDD

## ADR-003: Specification Pattern for Queries

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
Originally had LINQ queries directly in domain methods, violating DDD principles and making testing difficult.

### Decision
Implement Specification Pattern to:
- Encapsulate query logic in domain specifications
- Move LINQ expressions out of domain services
- Enable reusable and composable query logic

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ Domain queries are testable and composable
- ✅ Clean separation between domain logic and data access
- ✅ LINQ expressions can be validated with integration tests
- ✅ Business query logic stays in domain layer

**Negative:**
- ❌ More abstractions to understand
- ❌ Initial migration effort from legacy LINQ methods

## ADR-004: Dual Testing Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
Need comprehensive testing that validates both business logic and data persistence behavior.

### Decision
Implement dual testing approach:
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, with mocks for business logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: With EF Core InMemory for real LINQ query validation

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ Business rules validated in isolation (unit tests)
- ✅ LINQ specifications validated against real database behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage without redundancy
- ✅ Fast feedback loop with unit tests

**Negative:**
- ❌ Two test suites to maintain
- ❌ Need to coordinate test data between approaches

---

## ADR-005: EF Core with InMemory Provider

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
Need data persistence that supports both development and testing scenarios.

### Decision
Use Entity Framework Core with:
- InMemory provider for development and testing
- Repository pattern to abstract persistence details
- DbContext configuration for future database migrations

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ No external database dependencies for development
- ✅ Fast test execution
- ✅ Easy to migrate to real database later
- ✅ Repository pattern provides clean abstraction

**Negative:**
- ❌ InMemory provider doesn't validate all real database constraints
- ❌ May miss database-specific behavior during development

---

## ADR-006: Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-20  

### Context
API needs comprehensive documentation for frontend developers and API consumers.

### Decision
Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI with:
- Automatic schema generation
- Comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples
- Business rule validation documentation

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ✅ Self-documenting API
- ✅ Interactive testing interface
- ✅ Contract-first development support
- ✅ Reduced API documentation maintenance

**Negative:**
- ❌ Additional configuration overhead
- ❌ Need to maintain XML documentation comments
